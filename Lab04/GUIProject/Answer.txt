1. 
- JFrame (Swing):
	•	JFrame is a top-level container provided by Swing for creating windows in a Java application.
	•	It provides features like decorations (title bar, borders, etc.), layout management, and event handling.
	•	JFrame is lightweight and platform-independent.
	•	It's typically used for creating standalone applications.
	•	- Frame (AWT):
	•	Frame is the top-level container provided by AWT for creating windows.
	•	It also provides decorations and event handling but lacks some of the advanced features provided by JFrame.
	•	Frame is heavyweight and relies on the underlying operating system's windowing system.
	•	It's used for creating applications that might require integration with native code or when legacy support is needed.
2. In Swing, class names typically start with a "J" prefix to distinguish them from their AWT counterparts.

AWT Event Handling:
- Listeners:
	•	In AWT, event handling relies heavily on listeners. Components typically have methods to register listeners for specific types of events.
	•	For example, to handle button clicks, you would add an ActionListener to the button using the addActionListener() method.
- Event Model:
	•	AWT uses the delegation event model, where events are dispatched from the source component to registered listeners.
	•	Events are dispatched in a top-down manner, starting from the source component and propagating up the containment hierarchy until a listener consumes the event or it reaches the top-level container.
- Event Classes:
	•	AWT defines various event classes for different types of events, such as ActionEvent for action-related events, MouseEvent for mouse-related events, etc.
Swing Event Handling:
- Listeners:
	•	Swing also uses listeners for event handling, but it typically provides more listener interfaces compared to AWT.
	•	For example, Swing components might have separate interfaces for handling mouse events (MouseListener), keyboard events (KeyListener), focus events (FocusListener), etc.
- Event Model:
	•	Swing uses a similar delegation event model as AWT, but it may handle events differently internally.
	•	Swing components often override methods related to event handling, allowing for more customization compared to AWT.
- Event Classes:
	•	While Swing reuses some of the event classes from AWT, it also introduces its own event classes, especially for more specialized components and events.
	•	Swing might provide subclasses or enhancements of AWT event classes to support additional features specific to Swing components.
Differences:
- Platform Independence:
	•	Swing's event handling is more consistent across different platforms compared to AWT due to its lightweight nature and greater control over event propagation.
- Customization:
	•	Swing often allows for more customization in event handling due to its more extensive listener interfaces and support for subclassing and overriding methods.
- Performance:
	•	Swing's lightweight nature generally results in better performance in event handling compared to AWT, especially for complex GUIs with numerous components.
