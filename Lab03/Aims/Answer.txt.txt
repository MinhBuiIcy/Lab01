- Class Media will implement the Comparable interface
- In class Media, I will overide compareTo() method, of which return positive if the instance call the method has lexicographically higher postition, negative if the instance call the method has lexicographically lower postition, 0 if otherwise.
- No, the compareTo() method in the Comparable interface can only define a single natural ordering for the objects.
- I will let my DigitalVideoDisc implement Comparable interface, overide compareTo() method:
If the title of the instance called has lexicographically higher postition, return 1
If the title of the instance called has lexicographically lower postition, return -1
If otherwise:
	If the length of the instance called has lexicographically higher postition, return 1
	If the length of the instance called has lexicographically lower postition, return -1
	If otherwise:
		If the cost of the instance called has lexicographically higher postition, return 1
		If the cost of the instance called has lexicographically lower postition, return -1
